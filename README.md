# Socio-Economic Determinants of Global Well-being

### Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between economic indicators (GDP per capita) and public health outcomes (Life Expectancy, Infant Mortality). We analyzed global data to determine if financial prosperity is the sole driver of a healthier population.

### Key Findings
* Strong positive correlation between GDP and Life Expectancy.
* Infant mortality drops significantly once a country reaches an economic threshold of ~$15k GDP.
* Nutrition (specifically animal protein intake) is a key mechanism linking wealth to health.

### Tools Used
* Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
* Jupyter Notebook
